This repository contains code to create a [basic shiny application](https://hassan-saad.shinyapps.io/sample_app/).  

1. All code to create the actual application is in the "app.R" script within the sample_app folder. 
2. The "deploy_app.R" script within the sample_app folder is a short script to deploy the application online and should not be run unless otherwise instructed. 
3. All raw data used by the application should be be stored in the "data" folder within the sample_app folder. Otherwise the Shiny application will not deploy.
